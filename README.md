# Duara - a Blockchain-based Supply Chain Management dApp (mobile app)

A Blockchain-based dApp that attempts to alleviate the counterfeiting of drugs by illustrating the Supply Chain flow of the products from its manufacturer(s) all the way to the end-consumer in a transparent, secure, and affordable way, on the Ethereum blockchain, using smart contracts.

Fundamentally, the system would offer its users visibility, transparency, affordability, and confidence at every step.

## High Level Workflow Example:

  1. The drug manufacturer (owner of smart contract) creates a new product.
  2. The product is stored on the ethereum blockchain with all relevant details including a uniqe barcode for the identification of the      product.
  3. The created product is validated by a regulatory bosy, such as the government.
  4. Before making a purchase, the buyer can validate the authenticity of the drug by scanning the barcode label on the product.


Seller informs the customer who wants to purchase the item with a price and address to make the payment.
The sustomer is making a payment, transferring the funds to required address.
Payment is automatically detected by listening to the events on a smart contract.
Once the payment is completed and detected, now the seler can update the status of product, to notify the warehouse to ship the product to the customer.
